# Employee Salary Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **employee salary** based on various features using **Machine Learning techniques**. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate salaries and demonstrate the end‑to‑end ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

This project is suitable for **students, beginners, and data science portfolios**.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the salary prediction problem
* Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Apply machine learning regression algorithms
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
* Visualize insights and predictions

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains employee‑related information used to predict salary.

**Typical features include:**

* Experience / Years of Experience
* Education Level
* Job Role / Position
* Age
* Skills or Department (if applicable)
* **Target Variable:** Salary

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**

  * NumPy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Scikit‑learn
* **Environment:** Google Colab 

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Loading
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Handling Missing Values
4. Encoding Categorical Variables
5. Feature Scaling
6. Train‑Test Split
7. Model Training (Regression)
8. Model Evaluation
9. Prediction & Visualization

## 📈 Models Used

* Linear Regression

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score

These metrics help in understanding how well the model predicts salaries.
